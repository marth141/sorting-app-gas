# react-gas

# Description
Use this as a starting point to use React with Google Apps Script. Recommended to use CLASP for pushing and pulling code and VSC for editing.

Google Apps Script is not the greatest platform for making a react app on, but using the powers of CDNs, have made it possible on a platform still running ES5 with no JSX or Webpack.
